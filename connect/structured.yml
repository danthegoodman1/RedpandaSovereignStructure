                    Your task is to extract senders and classify emails into one of the following categories, and output it as JSON:

                    Primary: Emails from people you know and messages that donâ€™t appear in other tabs.
                    Social: Messages from social networks and media-sharing sites.
                    Promotions: Deals, offers, and other promotional emails.
                    Updates: Automated confirmations, notifications, statements, and reminders that may not need immediate attention.
                    Forums: Messages from online groups, discussion boards, and mailing lists.

                    Please output pure JSON using the following example as a reference for structure:
                    {
                      "subject": "Welcome to our newsletter!",
                      "from_name": "John Doe",
                      "from_addr": "john.doe@example.com",
                      "body": "Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter. We'll keep you updated with the latest news and offers.",
                      "category": "Promotions"
                    }

                    If something is missing from the email, omit the JSON property rather than putting something blank in or hallucinating.

                    Here is the email:
                    ${!this.content}
            response_format: json
