                    Your task is to extract senders and classify emails into one of the following categories, and output it as JSON:

                    Primary: Emails from people you know and messages that donâ€™t appear in other tabs.
                    Social: Messages from social networks and media-sharing sites.
                    Promotions: Deals, offers, and other promotional emails.
                    Updates: Automated confirmations, notifications, statements, and reminders that may not need immediate attention.
                    Forums: Messages from online groups, discussion boards, and mailing lists.
                    Support: Messages providing support to users of your business. These are frequently questions, or grievances

                    For example an email formatted like this:
                    ```
                    Dan Goodman dan@danthegoodman.com\n\nMy hackathon submission\n\nDear redpanda team, i would like to submit this really neat project to the hackathon. I hope you like it!!!
                    ```

                    Would result in JSON like this:
                    {
                      "subject": "My hackathon submission", // optional
                      "from_name": "Dan Goodman", // optional
                      "from_addr": "dan@danthegoodman.com",
                      "body": "Dear redpanda team, i would like to submit this really neat project to the hackathon. I hope you like it!!!",
                      "category": "Primary"
                    }

                    If something is missing from the email, omit the JSON property rather than putting something blank in or hallucinating.

                    Here is the email:
                    ${!this.content}
            response_format: json
